    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Nishan Mainali, a passionate data science student with a deep-rooted interest in technology. My journey began in a small town in Nepal, where curiosity for computers and tech sparked at an early age. Growing up, I always found myself captivated by how technology shapes the world around us. That fascination only grew as I moved to Kathmandu for high school, where I immersed myself further into the digital world.

    During my final year of high school, something unexpected happened—COVID-19. As the pandemic paused everything, including my final exams, I turned to learning new skills. From Photoshop and video editing to coding in Python, I used that time to dive into different realms of creativity and technology. It was then that I stumbled upon data science, and a whole new world of possibilities opened up for me. I was instantly drawn to how data can be used to uncover patterns, predict outcomes, and solve real-world problems. I spent hours watching YouTube videos, reading articles, and teaching myself the basics.

    Realizing my passion for data science, I knew I had to take it further. Unfortunately, I discovered that no universities in Nepal offered an undergraduate program in data science. But that didn’t stop me. Determined to follow my dream, I looked beyond borders and found my place at Arkansas State University in the U.S., where I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Data Science.

    Now, as a junior at Arkansas State, I’m constantly driven to learn and grow. With every project and every new skill I acquire, I’m one step closer to my goal of becoming a data-driven problem solver. Whether it’s analyzing data, coding in Python, or learning about machine learning models, I thrive on the excitement of discovery.

    I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact, and I’m excited to be a part of this ever-evolving field. Thank you for visiting my portfolio—there’s so much more to come!
